# CVStepByStep

A simple collection of Python scripts demonstrating various computer vision tasks with OpenCV.  

# Final Goal

Use visual odometry to predict movement relative to the floor with a stabilized camera setup. 

My setup would be: camera flying at a fixed height of 200 meters over cities or forests, capturing 1280x720 images at 15 frames per second with a 110Â° field of view (FOV). 

Assuming perfect conditions, great lighting, no weather issues, and a stabilized platform.

# Steps

1. Learn basic of OpenCV

2. Learn about Feature detection with opencv
- Color detection
- Edge detection
- Hybrid detection

3. Learn about optical flow
- Look once and track
- Look and track first and repeat (hybrid approach)

4. Learn about ORB feature detection
- Mix ORB and Optical Flow
-
